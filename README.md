My Personal Website

This project focused on 'getting back to the roots' of web programmming, and hardcoding an entire site. Rather than picking up a template and changing a few things here and there.

The aim was to create a beautiful, user-friendly site from scratch, and I did using HTML5, JS, CSS3, and Bootstrap for styling.

It's also a personal goal as the beginning of my journey to making my own templates after years of struggling to find good templates.
