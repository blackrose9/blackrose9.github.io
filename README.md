Personal Website(under-development)

This project will just focus on 'getting back to the roots' of web programmming, and hardcoding an entire site. Rather than picking up a template and changing a few things here and there.

The aim is to create a beautiful, user-friendly site from scratch.

It's also a personal goal as the beginning of my journey to making my own templates after years of struggling to find good templates(i.e. coded properly with clear comments).
